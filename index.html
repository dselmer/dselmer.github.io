                    <p>
                        He is a megagenius scientist whose alcoholism and reckless,
                        nihilistic behavior are sources of concern for his "daughter's"
                        family, as well as the safety of their son, Morty. Upon the
                        series' inception, Rick's mysterious origins and mental health
                        were large sources of speculation.

                        Though exploitative and demanding, Rick genuinely cares about his grandson and values their
                        adventures together, making him one of the few Ricks to do so. He hesitates to outwardly show
                        any love or appreciation however, making sure Morty doesn't get cocky.

                    <p>
                        Rick loves his daughter, and for the most part is kind to her. However, his treatment of her may
                        just be a ploy to stay on her good side so he can continue to stay at her home and continue his
                        adventures with Morty, although during "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind" many Ricks from
                        different dimensions seem to like C-137 Rick's daughter, proving that he might have true
                        feelings for his daughter.

                    <p>
                        Rick initially cared very little for and paid scarce attention to his granddaughter, saying her
                        opinion meant "very little" to him. As time went on, however, the two began to bond and go on
                        their own adventures, making her - in a sense - Rick's second sidekick

                    <p>
                        Rick has little to no respect for Jerry and uses any chance he gets to demean or humiliate him,
                        whether it's constantly reminding him of his failing marriage to Beth or mocking his low
                        intelligence. Rick seems to somewhat resent the fact that Jerry had sex with Beth, and got her
                        pregnant (with Summer) at seventeen.
