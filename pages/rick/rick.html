                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Rick is a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including
                    brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, cloning
                    technology, cybernetic implants, various energy weapons and force fields, and the world's first
                    amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded
                    personal views and his alcoholic tendencies.

                <h2>Substance Abuse</h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, Rick's consumption of alcohol is presented more from a comedic viewpoint throughout the
                    series' run, but in the Season 1 finale "Ricksy Business", Bird Person claims that Rick is in "great
                    pain" (citing his catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!" as meaning "I am in great pain. Please help
                    me."
