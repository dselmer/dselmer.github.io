                    <p>
                        Prior to the beginning of the series, Rick had a fairly normal middle-class childhood and had
                        developed an interest in tinkering with things at a young age. As an adult, he married a woman
                        named Diane and they had a daughter, Beth. Rick eventually became a scientist who was struggling
                        to invent teleportation. One day, he was visited by an alternate version of himself, who offered
                        him the ability to travel to different realities, but Rick refused. Insulted by what he
                        perceived as a lesser version of himself acting as though he was better, Rick Prime sent a bomb
                        through a portal to kill Rick C-137's Diane and Beth. Rick grieved for an unknown period of
                        time, before inventing his own portal gun and going on a quest for revenge. As more and more
                        Ricks began hunting Prime for the same reason, Prime invented the Omega Device, throwing in a
                        version of Diane to wipe out their wife across existence.

                        Rick would spend the next few decades searching for the Rick who murdered his family. He
                        eventually became a weapons dealer, trying to find parts for a device to help him track down the
                        one who killed his family. Rick eventually met Birdperson at a festival[18], and formed rock
                        band called "The Flesh Curtains" together with Squanchy.[19] The three eventually formed the

                <h2>Personality</h2>
                <p>
                    Rick is a genius scientist, capable of creating complex scientific inventions, including
                    brain-enhancing helmets, dream-invading devices, portals to several different dimensions, cloning
                    technology, cybernetic implants, various energy weapons and force fields, and the world's first
                    amusement park inside the body of a living human. His brilliance can be muddled by his jaded
                    personal views and his alcoholic tendencies.

                <h2>Substance Abuse</h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, Rick's consumption of alcohol is presented more from a comedic viewpoint throughout the
                    series' run, but in the Season 1 finale "Ricksy Business", Bird Person claims that Rick is in "great
                    pain" (citing his catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!" as meaning "I am in great pain. Please help
                    me."
